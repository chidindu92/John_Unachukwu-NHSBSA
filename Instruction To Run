Run Instruction
==========================
To run this project, open the project, ensure you have chrome and firefox browsers
installed in your machine.

Open the folder 'John_Unachukwu-NHSBSA', while in the folder, open a command prompt
(Git-bash or Terminal or CMD) and then type : 'mvn clean install'
or 'mvn test' in the command line without the quotation marks.
Make sure the path it is pointing is correct.

Note:
Having gone through the acceptance criteria for test coverage,
it seem that a user from Wales will be granted help with NHS cost.
However, Iâ€™m not able to use the current build to generate a scenario
where the user from Wales will NOT be granted free help with NHS cost.
This means that the scenario created is based on the build given for testing.
